Given the previous steps as well as the immediate next step, you will generate and use the meta-tokens to arrive at that next step from the previous ones. You will also be provided the answer to ensure your generation is accurate, but you should not reference it at all. An annotation starts with the meta-token, followed by your usage of the token. Do not conclude meta-tokens with the same one and a slash, only by switching to a different meta-token.\n",
